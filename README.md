### Game Concept ###
> This is a game where Happy Tree Friends are on an conveyor belt, which leads them to a kill machine. 
> When in the machine upon a right command the cute animal is killed and death animation is started, when it exits the machine. 
> At the end of the conveyor belt there is a hole where the body is dropped. Each kill brings points. For every consecutive kill multiplier rises, and resets of failed kill. 
> 5 levels that are generated both with different type of tree friends and increase in frequency.
